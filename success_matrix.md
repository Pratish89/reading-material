# Scalable Test Automation Framework

## Overview
This repository contains a **scalable test automation framework** for UI, API, and backend services, designed using **Selenium, Playwright, Cypress, Karate DSL, and REST Assured**. The goal is to achieve **75-80% automation coverage** within the defined scope and integrate continuous testing into CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Features
- **UI Test Automation** using Selenium, Playwright, and Cypress
- **API Testing** using Karate DSL and REST Assured
- **Backend & Database Validation** using JDBC & SQL
- **CI/CD Integration** with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Azure DevOps
- **Parallel & Headless Execution** for faster test runs
- **Test Reporting & Analytics** with Allure, Extent Reports

## Success Metrics
To measure the success and effectiveness of the test automation framework, the following key metrics are implemented:

### 1. **Test Automation Coverage (%)**
- Measures the percentage of test cases automated out of total test scenarios.
- **Formula:**  
  `Automation Coverage (%) = (Number of Automated Test Cases / Total Test Cases) * 100`
- **Target:** 75-80%

### 2. **Test Execution Time (Reduction in Execution Time)**
- Measures how much time is saved compared to manual execution.
- **Formula:**  
  `Time Saved (%) = ((Manual Execution Time - Automated Execution Time) / Manual Execution Time) * 100`
- **Target:** Reduce execution time by at least 50%.

### 3. **Defect Detection Rate (%)**
- Measures the number of defects caught by automated tests before production.
- **Formula:**  
  `Defect Detection Rate (%) = (Defects Found by Automation / Total Defects Found) * 100`
- **Target:** Increase defect detection rate to 60-70%.

### 4. **Test Stability & Flakiness Rate (%)**
- Measures the reliability of automated tests.
- **Formula:**  
  `Flakiness Rate (%) = (Number of Flaky Test Failures / Total Test Runs) * 100`
- **Target:** Keep flakiness rate below 5%.

### 5. **Regression Testing Efficiency (%)**
- Measures the efficiency of automated regression testing.
- **Formula:**  
  `Regression Efficiency (%) = (Manual Effort Saved by Automation / Total Regression Effort) * 100`
- **Target:** Reduce manual regression effort by 60%.

### 6. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration & Stability**
- Tracks the percentage of test executions integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Key Metrics:**
  - % of tests running in CI/CD pipeline
  - Pass rate of automated tests in CI/CD
- **Target:** Ensure 90% of tests run successfully in CI/CD pipelines.

### 7. **Cross-Browser & API Test Execution Success Rate (%)**
- Measures the success rate of test executions across multiple browsers and API endpoints.
- **Formula:**  
  `Execution Success Rate (%) = (Successful Test Runs / Total Test Runs) * 100`
- **Target:** Maintain an execution success rate of **95% or higher**.

### 8. **Test Maintenance Effort (Reduction in Test Fixing Time)**
- Measures the time required to maintain automated test scripts.
- **Target:** Reduce maintenance effort by 40% using self-healing locators & modular framework design.

## Reporting & Monitoring
- **Test Execution Reports:** Integrated with **Allure & Extent Reports**.
- **Real-Time Dashboards:** Using **Grafana, Kibana** for monitoring test trends.
- **CI/CD Logs & Notifications:** Automated failure alerts via Slack & Email.
